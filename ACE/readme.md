Transfering code from code.taobao.org and KingSoft Cloud.  

The project of Bayesian P-spline and linear mixture model.  

Part I with ONLY linear mixture model is done using RCPP and GSL. See ACE_standard_cpp.cpp

Still working on PartII LMM with Bayesian P-spline. See ACE_transform_cpp.cpp

An R version is already done but too slow.

The Rcpp version is nearly ninety times faster than R version.
