# Bayesian Data Analysis in R
Transfering code from code.taobao.org and KingSoft Cloud.
Bayesian Method for different models.
Mainly for EM and MCMC algorithms.  
1. ACE is a transform model using Bayesian p-spline to change observed Y into Y-star ~ Normal Distribution. And then a mixtured model of linear regression is used to fit Y-star and X to tell the difference between fraternal twinsã€‚  
2. EM_* is a simulation of Finite Mixture Model which consist of two Normal componenets.
